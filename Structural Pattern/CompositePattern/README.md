# Composite Pattern
Composite Pattern is used to compose objects into tree structures and treats the object uniformly.

### When we should use Composite Pattern:
- Represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
- Able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. So, the clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
