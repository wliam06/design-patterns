# Facade Pattern
Facade pattern is provides a simplified interface to a complex system or structural code. With facade we can:
 - Improve the readability and usability by masking interaction with more complex components.
 - Provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality.

### When we should use it:
 - When a system is very complex and difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client.
