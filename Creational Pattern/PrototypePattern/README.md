# Prototype Pattern
Prototype pattern is used to instance a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object.

### When we should use it:
 - When a system should be independent of how its product are created, composed and represented.
 - Avoid subclassed of an object in the client.
 - More convenient to copy an existing instance than to create one.
