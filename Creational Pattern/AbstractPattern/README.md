# Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract factory pattern is used to encapsulate a group and produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Why we should use it:
 - Helps us to control the classes of objects that an application created and dependent.
 
 ## When we should use it:
 - If we want to use multiple families or products with the subset of families of product will be used at any time.
