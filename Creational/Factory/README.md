# Factory Pattern
Factory pattern is uses to encapsulates the implementation details of creating objects without knowing how the objects are actually being created.

### What is different about Factory and Abstract Pattern:
- `Factory Pattern` is a single method and `Abstract Pattern` is an object.
- `Factory Pattern` can be uses inheritences and relies on a subclass.
- `Abstract Pattern` is an object that has multiple factory methods. It means a class delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to another object via `composition`.

### When we should use it:
- Flexibility, it helps to centerized for constructing the object.
