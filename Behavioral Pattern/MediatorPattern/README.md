# Mediator Pattern
Mediator pattern is used to defined an object that encapsulates how a set object interact without tight any classes.

### When we should use it:
 - When the complexity of object want to communicate between objects in a system.
 - Helping to loose coupling and reduces of subclasses in system.
 - Helping in replacing `many-to-many` relationship with `one-to-many` relationship.
