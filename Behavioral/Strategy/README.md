# Strategy Pattern

Strategy pattern is a process from encapsulates algorithms in classes, making them reusable and interchangeable at runtime.

### When we should use it:
 - Do the same thing with different ways.
 - Alternative to if/else or switch-case blocks.

The `Startegy pattern` is one of the most useful and simple to use. By using this pattern has advantages maybe you may know:
 * `Single Responsibility` means that every class or module should have one and only one of changed or modification.
 * `Open/Close Principle` means that classes should be oen for extension but closed for modification.
